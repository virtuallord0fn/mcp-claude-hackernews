## Introduction

Hacker News is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship. It allows users to submit articles, comment on posts, and vote on submissions. This integration enhances the **Claude Desktop** experience by enabling it to pull data from Hacker News through a simple and efficient API.

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** provides a framework for communication between Claude Desktop and various data sources, including Hacker News. With this integration, users can quickly access news articles, comments, and other relevant information without leaving the Claude environment.
